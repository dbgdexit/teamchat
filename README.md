# teamchat

A small teamchat script for your FiveM server which allows you to communicate with your team without tabbing out of the game. It displays every information needed for you to take action in case of an emergency like a modder. Have fun with this script and if you have any issue just open a new issue. Maybe you have some improvemnts for the code aswell so just fork the repo.
